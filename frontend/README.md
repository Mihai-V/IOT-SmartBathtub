# Getting Started 

To get started, go to the frontend folder and copy the environment example. 
```
cd frontend
cp .env.example .env
```
Ensure it will be connected to the same MQTT server as the C++ main app.

Install the dependencies (you will need Node):
```
npm install
```

Serve the app locally:
```
npm run start
```

Happy hacking!
